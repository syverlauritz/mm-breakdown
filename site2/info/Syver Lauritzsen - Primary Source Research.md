### Personal Philosophy
"I get bored really fast. It's what pushes me to explore new technologies and creative approaches, always looking for something that surprises or entertains. This restlessness means I've picked up skills across a wide range of areas, from interactive installations to oil painting. But while I move quickly and dive into many different things, I never let that impact the quality of my work. For me, the challenge is to keep things engaging without cutting corners, ensuring that every project is both exciting and meticulously crafted."

**Core Belief**: "Because when the designer has fun, so does the user."
