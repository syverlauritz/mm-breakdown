The lion and robot were inpainted on an appropriately lit carpet using Midjourney. Alludes to Wittgenstein's famous quote, "If a lion could speak, we could not understand him," which highlights the limitations of language and understanding. 

It suggests that even if a lion could use human language, its meaning and experience would be so different from ours that we couldn't truly grasp its perspective. 

The core idea is that understanding goes beyond simply knowing the words and syntax; it involves sharing a similar "form of life" and understanding the underlying meaning and context. Which is very relevant to the story here.
